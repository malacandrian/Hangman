The game chooses a secret word  and tells the player its length\r\n2. Each turn the player can either\r\n * Ask the game if the word contains a character\r\n      * If it does, the player is told which position(s) the character lies in\r\n      * If it does not, the player loses 1 life.\r\n      * If the player loses 10 lives, they lose\r\n * Guess what the word is\r\n      * If the player is correct, they win \r\n      * If the player is incorrect, they lose\r\n\r\n\r\n###Strategy\r\nBecause penalties are only incurred for incorrect guesses, the optimal strategy is not to eliminate as large a portion of potential words as possible, but rather to make as few incorrect guesses as possible. This can be achieved by always selecting the character that appears in the most words that are still possible in a given game state. \r\n\r\ne.g. Given the game state \"a _ _ u _ e\" Incorrect letters: c, d\r\n\r\nThe possible remaining words are : abjure, allure, ampule, arouse, assume, assure, astute, attune\r\n\r\nThe unguessed characters appear with the following frequencies b-1, j-1, l-2, m-2, n-1, o-1, p-1, r-3, s-4, t-2\r\n\r\nTherefore, our next best guess is 's'. When this gives us the pattern \"as _ u _ e\" this only leaves \"astute\", therefore the word is solved.\r\n\r\nThis requires a level of calculation that is not possible for a human to perform during a standard game of hangman, instead the [standard distribution of characters in English](http://norvig.com/mayzner.html) can be used as an approximation. That is, always choose the characters in the following order etaoinsrhldcumfpgwybvkxjqz \r\n\r\nThese two strategies will be referred to as the **Optimal Strategy** and the **Easy Strategy** respectively.\r\n##How do we define a \"Good Word\"?\r\nA good word is a word that is hard to guess. A hard to guess word takes a large number of attempts before the word is calculated. Because the player is only penalised for mistakes we want a word that will cause the player to make a large number of incorrect guesses. Finally, because the player only gets 10 lives, and will therefore be making a guess at 9 incorrect characters we want there to be as many open options at that point as possible.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the metrics we will be ranking the words on are\r\n\r\n * Number of guesses required\r\n * Number of incorrect guesses required\r\n * How many possibilities there are after 9 incorrect characters\r\n\r\n##What makes one word better than another?\r\nInstinctively we tend to choose long words when we want to make the game harder. The two key reasons I can see for this are\r\n\r\n * Reduced word familiarity\r\n * More letters means more guessing\r\n\r\nBecause the program is familiar with the entire dictionary it has been given the second is not a factor we can study, though as it is poor sportsmanship to choose a word no one else has heard of this is not a problem. As any given character only needs to be guessed once no matter how frequently it appears a high number of unique characters should be used. The final tactic that should jump out upon examining the player's strategy is to choose rare letters, as they are less likely to guess them.\r\n\r\n##Collecting the data\r\nA program was written to test [a list of over 58000 words](http://www.mieliestronk.com/corncob_lowercase.txt) (henceforth reffered to as \"the dictionary\") on both the easy and optimal strategies, outputting its results as a CSV, Excel and PowerPivot were then used to analyse the results.\r\n###The Program\r\nAt each step the program generates a Regex pattern to represent the current information about the word (in the example above it would have generated `^a[^acdeu][^acdeu]u[^acdeu]e$`). It then checks this against all remaining words to find the current set of possible words. If there is ever only one word in this set the problem has been solved. The process is performed twice, once using the easy strategy then again using the optimal one.\r\n\r\nThe program was written in C# across two main classes: `Word.cs` allows the words to be queried as to their contents, remembers what has been guessed, and creates the Regex patterns. `WordTester.cs` maintains the list of possible words and chooses the next character to guess at each step, as well as reporting when the word has been solved.\r\n\r\n*The source code is available, though if you want to run it yourself it should be noted that it performs an O(n^2) operation on the dictionary, so takes a while. About 4 hours/run on my laptop.*\r\n\r\n##The results\r\n###What makes a word bad?\r\nBefore we work out what makes a word good it's worth looking at factors we thought would help but either have no affect, or actually make the word easier to guess.\r\n####Length\r\nOne of the most surprising results is that long words are easier to guess than shorter ones. Despite being longer, they require fewer guesses to discern the word, and incur many fewer mistakes. There are 469 words that require only 1 character to eliminate all other options. Nearly 90% of these are 10 characters or longer.\r\n\r\n!!!GRAPH 1 - Word difficulty against length!!!\r\n\r\nAs the word length increases the number of possible arrangements increases much faster than the number of words increases (see the below graphs). This means that for any given pattern there are fewer words that match it as word length increases.\r\n\r\n!!!Graph: Word lengths\r\n!!!Graph: Word space use\r\n\r\ne.g. \"Onomatopoeia\" is a 12 letter word with 8 unique characters. There are 3102 possible 12 letter words in the dictionary (about 5%), with \"i\" the most common character among them. Plugging this in gives the pattern `\"_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ i _\"`, which only 67 words match. We're now down to 2% of 12 letter words, or 0.1% of the dictionary in 1 guess. The next guess is \"o\" giving us a pattern of `\"o _ o _ _ _ o _ o _ i _\"` which is only matched by \"onomatopoeia\".\r\n\r\nPlaying against the easy strategy, the word contains the 6 most common characters, and after 3 (e, t, a) produces the pattern `\"_ _ _ _ at _ _ _ e _ a\"` which again can only be matched by \"onomatopoeia\".\r\n\r\n####Unique Characters\r\nFurthermore, having a high proportion of unique characters appears to have no discernible effect on word guess-ability, while high number of them makes the words easier to guess\r\n\r\n!!!GRAPH - Word diffuclty against unique chars!!!\r\n\r\nThis should have been obvious: we want the player to make mistakes. The greater the number of unique characters in the word, the fewer mistakes the player can make, the higher the probability that they will get one right. A word with 16 or more unique characters is trivially solved.\r\n\r\nThe 4 longest words with 100% unique characters are \"copyrightable\", \"unpredictability\", \"unproblematic\", and \"hydromagnetic\". All of these are 13 characters long, and all guessable with no mistakes. \r\n\r\n###What makes a word good?\r\nWhat we want is a word with rare characters in common patterns. This means that at each step the player makes a mistake, but as few options as possible are eliminated as a result of the mistake\r\n\r\n###What is the best word?\r\nThe words that cause the players to make the greatest number of mistakes in the optimal and easy strategies are \"bill/dill\" (joint) and \"zap\" respectively. But when the player reaches 10 mistakes they're out, so it doesn't matter how many mistakes beyond 10 it takes, but rather how ambiguous it is after 9 mistakes.\r\n\r\nThe optimal strategy's biggest gap is a group of 16 words matching the pattern `\"_ u _ _\"` `incorrect characters: e a o i s r l n m` These words are  buck, buff, butt, buzz, cuff, duck,  duct, duff, duty, fuzz, huff, puff, putt, tuck, tuft, and yuck.\r\n\r\nThe easy strategy has a space of 48 possibilities matching the pattern `\"_ a _\"` `incorrect characters: e t a o i n s r h`. These words are bad, bag, bap, bay, cab, cad, cam, cap, caw, dab, dad, dam, day, fab, fad, fag, fax, gab, gad, gag, gap, gay, jab, jag, jam, jap, jaw, jay, mac, mad, mag, map, maw, may, pad, pap, paw, pay, wad, wag, wax, way, yak, yam, yap, yaw, zag, and zap.\r\n\r\nOf course, this does assume that your opponent hasn't also read this and isn't adjusting their strategy accordingly. If they know you're playing off the reduced list, and use the optimal strategy (the list is short enough that it is possible) every word is guessable with only 7 mistakes. \r\n\r\nEven if they aren't it's probably very boring to always choose a 3 letter word containing the letter 'a'. So use this power wisely.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
