The game chooses a secret word  and tells the player its length\r\n2. Each turn the player can either\r\n * Ask the game if the word contains a character\r\n      * If it does, the player is told which position(s) the character lies in\r\n      * If it does not, the player loses 1 life.\r\n      * If the player loses 10 lives, they lose\r\n * Guess what the word is\r\n      * If the player is correct, they win \r\n      * If the player is incorrect, they lose\r\n###Strategy\r\nBecause penalties are only incurred for incorrect guesses, the optimal strategy is not to eliminate as large a portion of potential words as possible, but rather to make as few incorrect guesses as possible. This can be achieved by always selecting the character that appears in the most words that are still possible in a given game state.\r\n\r\ne.g. Given the game state \"a _ _ u _ e\" Incorrect letters: c, d\r\n\r\nThe possible remaining words are : abjure, allure, ampule, arouse, assume, assure, astute, attune\r\n\r\nThe unguessed characters appear with the following frequencies b-1, j-1, l-2, m-2, n-1, o-1, p-1, r-3, s-4, t-2\r\n\r\nTherefore, our next best guess is 's'. When this gives us the pattern \"as _ u _ e\" this only leaves \"astute\", therefore the word is solved.\r\n\r\nThis requires a level of calculation that is not possible for a human to perform during a standard game of hangman, instead the [standard distribution of characters in English](http://norvig.com/mayzner.html) can be used as an approximation. That is, always choose the characters in the following order etaoinsrhldcumfpgwybvkxjqz \r\n\r\nThese two strategies will be referred to as the **Optimal Strategy** and the **Easy Strategy** respectively.\r\n##How do we define a \"Good Word\"?\r\nA good word is a word that is hard to guess. A hard to guess word takes a large number of attempts before the word is calculated. Because the player is only penalised for mistakes we want a word that will cause the player to make a large number of incorrect guesses. Finally, because the player only gets 10 lives, and will therefore be making a guess at 9 incorrect characters we want there to be as many open options at that point as possible.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the metrics we will be ranking the words on are\r\n\r\n * Number of guesses required\r\n * Number of incorrect guesses required\r\n * How many possibilities there are after 9 incorrect characters\r\n\r\n##Collecting the data\r\nA program was written to test [a list of over 58000 words](http://www.mieliestronk.com/corncob_lowercase.txt) on both the easy and optimal strategies, outputting its results as a CSV, Excel was then used to analyse the results.\r\n###The Program\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
